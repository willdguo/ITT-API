# ITT-API: API for extracting text from an image

Combines the pytesseract OCR tool with autocorrect library from https://github.com/filyp/autocorrect to fix any OCR mistakes

Allows users to select any image from files, as well as create a screenshot in img.png locally. Once an image is chosen to be read, the text is written into text.txt

Uses tkinter for frontend
